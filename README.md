# Ruby by example
---
#### This repo is updated constantly as I go through the courses. 
I decided to make a little repo with all the notes and examples I've taken when I was learning Ruby from Codecademy.com

Each section (as taught in order on Codecademy) is named as such.

Hope you find it useful!

## Examples: What you can expect in each file.
```ruby
puts "Adds new line after printing inside quotes"
print "Does not add new line after printing."
#--------
#Setting a variable
var_name = "string"#Strings, Intergers, Boolean, etc.
#When using a ( ! ) at the end of an variable,
#it modifies the value contained within the variable itself.
var_name = "loland"
var2 = var_name.capitalize
var_name.capitalize!
# The next time you use the variable var_name you will get the results of var2.capitalize
```

## Usage

Please do not try to run each file as an normal Ruby script, these are meant to be opened and read through.
